CryptoPirates README

Learning Lesson for Crypto while following the CryptoZombies courses at https://cryptozombies.io/

Thoughts so far:
- Have to take a completely different appraoch to optimization.
	- Non-view functions cost Gas
	- Build arrays in place as opposed to in Storage on the Blockchain to limit cogging the Blockchain.
- Strings are a newer contruct to Solidity and don't have many basic functions built-in.
	- Concatenation
	- String to Integer
- Truffle comment lines causing errors. Making it hard to properly comment code.
	- https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/932
- To save on Gas
	- Struct Packing. Ethereum reserves 256 bits for a uint. So within a struct, package into that space with smaller ints if possible.
